        <p class="technology-text">To understand how a Quantum computer works one must first understand how a regular computer works. A computer a device that essentially takes an input from the user, processes it and outputs it back to the user or
          stores the processed information. The smallest form of data in a computer is a bit which is either a 0 or 1. No matter what the computer is asked to perform, the underlying process is the same. A part of the task or input is first
          translated into a string of 0s and 1s which is called machine language. It is then processed in the CPU by an algorithm. The CPU gives back the output which is also a string of 0s and 1s. It may be translated into a language that the user
          can understand and be displayed or it may be stored on an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) or an SSD (Solid State Drive) for permanent storage or onto the RAM (Random Access Memory) for temporary storage. No matter how simple or complicated an
          algorithm is, it essentially always does the same thing; manipulate strings of 0s and 1s or bits. These values may be represented by a flowing current or when there is no current flowing in the circuit. This flow of current is controlled by
          the transistors found in the CPU. Complex arrangements of these form logic gats which allow the computer to manipulate the user’s input.
        </p>
        <p class="technology-text">To upgrade the processing power of these systems the processing chip of the computer must contain more transistors, to control the flow of the bits of information. This has led to the manufacturing of even smaller
          transistors. However, this approach has certain issues mainly based on the fact that in the microscopic world, things are not as definite as those in our normal world. As our transistors start to become smaller, some beginning to reach the
          size of just a few atoms, the electrons are able to pass through these barriers through a process called quantum tunnelling. Quantum tunnelling is a phenomenon where a subatomic particle’s probability disappears from one side of a potential
          barrier and appears on the other side. Due to this, there is a limit on the size of transistors we can create and therefore on the processing power of the computer. Another disadvantage to this system is that each bit can only ever occur in
          any one of its two states, ie: 0 or 1, limiting the number of calculations possible per second.</p>

          Quantum computing takes advantage of the uncertainty related to the microscopic world. While a computer uses bits as the basic unit of information, a quantum computer uses q-bits or quantum bits. In a quantum computer various elemental particles such as photons and electrons may be used. Quantum computers rely on some main quantum properties such as superposition and quantum entanglement.
        </p>
        <p class="technology-text">
          The First property that makes quantum computers so useful and powerful, is superposition. Superposition is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. It states that any two or more quantum states can be added together or superposed, resulting in another valid quantum state. The converse for this phenomenon is also true. Every quantum state can be represented as a sum of two or more distinct states. IN quantum computers, the particles are a superposition of two states, each on e representing either a 0 or a one 1. It exists as a combination of both the states, however when it is measured, it will only display one of them. This property can be very useful as it allows for each q-bit to store two values at once. If we take four classical bits, they can have a total of 2^4 different combinations out of which we can only use one at any single point of time. However if we take four q-bits, the system completely changes. They can also have a total of 2^4 combinations, but we can view all of them at the same time. With every q-bit added, this number increases exponentially. Just 20 q-bits can store over one million values all at once, allowing for multiple calculations to occur at once.
        </p>
        <p class="technology-text">
          Another major quantum property that is used by quantum computers is quantum entanglement. When one quantum particles is entangled with another their states become related. This essentially means that if we measure that state of one quantum particle, we can immediately deduce the state of the other as they are related. This property of quantum particles can low for faster processing and we don’t have to measure the states of two individual particles, saving time.

          <p class="technology-text">
            While a normal logic gate in a computer gets a definite set of inputs a gives a definite output, a quantum gate processes an input of superpositions and gives and output of superpositions. This output then has to be measured to get a sequence of 0s and 1s. Quantum computers use series of gates to manipulate and entangle q-bits. The fact that they give the output as superpositions means that you can get all the possible calculations at the same time. While you can only measure one output at a time, clever use of superposition and entanglement can allow for this process to become exponentially faster. This cannot be done on a normal computer.
