      <p class="technology-text">Due to the speed advantage provided by quantum computers they can have a variety of uses, some including things that would take even the most powerful of computers a long time to do.</p>
      <p class="technology-text">
        The first major application of quantum computers is Quantum chemistry and simulating nature. Because of the sheer complexity and dynamic properties of nature, even the most powerful computers struggles to do this task. Even simple molecules
        like caffeine can be difficult to simulate on a regular computer because of the number of calculations that have to be done. This is where quantum computers will be a game changer. Their ability to perform complex calculations with ease and
        store multiple values at the same time will make it easy for them to simulate these kinds of molecules. We could even simulate quantum particles with a quantum computer. This could be especially useful for researchers, enabling us to find new
        medicines to cure diseases that we canâ€™ today.</p>
      <p class="technology-text">Another use of Quantum computers would be database searching. A normal computer would have to go through all the possibilities one by one to find the right answer. For large databases this process of individually
        searching through them could take a very long time. Here again due to the abilities of quantum computers it would take lesser time as several calculations can happen at once.</p>
      <p class="technology-text">A fourth use of quantum computers would be in the field of AI. AI is based on the principle of learning from experience. The program becomes more accurate as feedback is given until it begins to exhibit a learning
        behaviour. This feedback is based on calculating the probabilities of many possible choices. This may be difficult for traditional computers to do, however this task would be very easy for Quantum computers.</p>
      <p class="technology-text">A final use of Quantum computers would be in the field of weather forecasting. As it involves taking in multiple inputs from various different sources and computing the most feasible outcome, Quantum computing could
        be a breakthrough in this field, lowing for the weather to be forecasted much faster.</p>

      <p class="technology-text">There are many more uses for Quantum computers and we are only in the beginning stages of creating this technology. We are discovering many more uses for it and new, better ways to easily program these types of
        computers. While they may not replace our traditional computers fully they will enable us to compute much more complex things, especially those requiring several calculations to be done at once. This technology will allow for a better future,
        filled with extraordinary learning opportunities about ourselves and the world we live in.</p>
